        The Best Thing I ever Read
    </h1>
    <p>
      My father recently gave me the book called "Rich Dad Poor Dad". 
      Im only a couple chapter in but it definitely has changed my outlook on certain things.

    <p>
        The book goes on about comparing these two different father figures, one who has money and one who is less fortunate.
        It has definitely helped shape my view differently and help me take a step back when looking at certain things.
